                Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years ago, I’ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create web products for both business and consumer use.

I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.

I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source CMS like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Keystone.js and others) .

                I use HTML & CSS (usually SASS) every day, and I try to keep up with the latest features while maintaining graceful degradation.

I use JavaScript fairly often, usually with jQuery. I also run Node.js-based workflow automation via Gulp or Grunt for web projects, and I’ve written other Node scripts to automate mundane tasks.

My main server-side language is PHP, quite often paired with MySQL. I usually use WordPress for client sites, depending on requirements. I specialize in custom themes, and have also built custom plugins for unique functionality.

I’ve developed several iOS and Android apps, both using native code and a JavaScript-based framework called Titanium SDK.

I learned ActionScript 3.0 when it first came out, when Flash was still ubiquitous and mobile devices were scarce. I’ve also dabbled with Haxe during Ludum Dare challenges.

I use Git for all of my programming work. Check out my GitHub page for random projects and contributions to other open source projects.

I primarily use GitHub’s Atom text editor for coding.

I maintain my own Linux server at home (Ubuntu) that acts as a staging site for project websites.
